# aero-overlay

A transparent window which is located above a target window to have the possibility to draw over it.
My initial code can be found in [1.0 branch](https://github.com/ReactiioN1337/aero-overlay/tree/1.0),
development takes place in `develop` branch. Do **not** push into the `master` branch.
